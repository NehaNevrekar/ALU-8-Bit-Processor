# ALU-8-Bit-Processor
***


## Problem Statement
Write a Verilog code and simulate 8 bit Processor which perform the following operations (Add, Multiply, Logical operations).



## Introduction
1) ALU is the fundamental building block of the processor, which is responsible for carrying out the arithmetic and logical functions.

2) ALU comprises of combinational logic that implements:-

->Arithmetic Operations

->Logical Operations

## Code Design
https://github.com/NehaNevrekar/ALU-8-Bit-Processor/issues/2#issue-696509619


## ALU Operations



## Opcode and Result
a) 000 Result = Operand1 + Operand2 (add)

b) 001 Result = Operand1 - Operand2 (sub)

c) 010 Result = Operand1 * Operand2 (mul)

d) 011 Result = Operand1 & Operand2 (and)

e) 100 Result = Operand1 | Operand2 (or)

f) 101 Result = ~(Operand1 & Operand2) (nand)

g) 110 Result = ~(Operand1 | Operand2) (nor)

h) 111 Result = Operand1 ^ Operand2 (xor)
